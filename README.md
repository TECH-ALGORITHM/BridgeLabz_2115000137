Assignment Summary: Java Arrays and Programming Practices

This assignment focuses on Java arrays and multidimensional arrays, covering creation, modification, and access using loops and the length property. Key operations include working with 2D arrays (matrices) to access elements, determine sizes, and iterate through rows and columns.

To ensure robust programming, I implemented input validation, error handling with System.err and exit(), and avoided hardcoding values. Proper naming conventions, comments, and indentation were followed throughout the code for clarity and maintainability.

In summary, this assignment demonstrates proficiency in array manipulation, error handling, and adherence to best coding practices while creating dynamic and flexible solutions.
